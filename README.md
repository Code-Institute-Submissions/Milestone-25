Milestone Project 2: Mission: Memoryphile

The rough draft of this idea is a spy-themed/ inspired memory matching game, with a timer countdown and a move count up/ down (TBD).
The website will be two pages: first having instructions and access to player records (local storage???). The second screen will contain 
the game itself (6x3) squares which the player will click/flip to match pairs, a timer and a move counter will be displayed.
