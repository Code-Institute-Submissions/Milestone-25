Milestone Project 2: Mission: Memoryphile
The concept behind this project is a spy-themed memory matching game, with a landing page setting the theme (providing the ‘mission’, and explaining the rules of the game), with a second page containing the game itself.
The game is made up of 18 squares, containing 9 hidden matching pairs. The player is able to click a square, revealing an image, then attempt to pair this image with its match by clicking another square to reveal a new image. Should the two images match, the cards remain revealed and the player’s score increases by one. Should the two images not match, both cards will return to their hidden state. Once all pairs are matched and revealed, the player wins – and a ‘mission success’ message is displayed, giving the player a summary of their score and providing the option to play again.
In addition to the match mechanic, game play has two further parameters; moves and time. The player has 60 seconds, and 20 moves in which to make all correct matches (this is to add some challenge to the game, and to prevent rapid random clicking as a means to win). Should the timer hit zero, or player moves hit 20, a ‘mission failure’ message is displayed, and the player is given the chance to play again.
At any point during the game, the player is able to return to the instructions by clicking the ‘home’ icon, or restart a new game by hitting the ‘replay’ button. 

UX
This project is intended for use as a fun mini-game to play quickly – without much set-up, and with little time requirement. For example, a user journey for a player would follow something like;
I’m waiting in a queue, and I want a distraction. I load the Memoryphile game to keep me entertained while the line is at a standstill. I need something that I can understand rapidly, that can be put away quickly, and that has replay value. I click the landing page, where the theme of the game confirms that this is a quick get-in-get-out play style. The rules are set out briefly, and the ‘mission play’ button takes me straight into the action. I’m able to finish my game within 60 seconds – and play again immediately. The shuffle function means I won’t be playing the same game twice. Should the queue move, or I get to my destination, I’m able to leave the game without worrying about losing a huge amount of progress.
